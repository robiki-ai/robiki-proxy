> A high-performance, secure reverse proxy service built with Node.js that supports HTTP/2, WebSocket, and streaming capabilities.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm i @robiki/proxy
```

```bash
yarn add @robiki/proxy
```

## 🌟 Features

- HTTP/2 Support: Full HTTP/2 protocol support with fallback to HTTP/1.1

- Multi-Port Support: Runs on both port 443 and 8080
- Stream Processing: Efficient streaming capabilities for real-time data

## 🛠️ Architecture

The proxy service consists of three main components:

1. REST API Handler: Manages HTTP/1.1 requests
2. Stream Handler: Handles HTTP/2 streams
3. WebSocket Handler: Manages WebSocket connections

## 🔧 Configuration

##### Domain Configuration

Configure target services by adding domain mappings:

```typescript
{
  'example.com': {
    target: 'service-name:3000'
  },
  'example.com:8080': {
    target: 'service-name:8080'
  }
}
```

##### SSL Configuration

Certs are generated by the [certs generator script](../../scripts/generators/certs.ts) with the command `yarn generate:certs` or during setup and are stored in the `certs` folder.
